# Getting Started

This repository is based on [Sam Herbert](https://github.com/SamHerbert)'s [SVG-Loaders](https://github.com/SamHerbert/SVG-Loaders) project. There are many loadig indicator display strategy like *JS, CSS, GIF, Lottie and Custom Fonts*. **SVG** is another loading indicator/spinner option because it's supporting animations natively on browsers and [widely supporting](https://caniuse.com/svg-smil). This project aims to provide ready-to-use SVG loader examples as components in *Angular, React, Vue, Svelte* without broke your development environment experience.

> Basicly we can use SVG files with `<img>` tag or import directly as inline code. You can not style SVG content over `<img>` tag. Also, inline option is not good for clean development experience. We created this project for smooth and better experience for developers.
